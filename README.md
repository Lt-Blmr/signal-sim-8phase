# signal-sim-8phase
A full 8-phase signal simulation based on real-world NEMA dual-ring logic. Built for Traffic Signals 101, this model shows how protected lefts, flashing yellows, pedestrian phases, and lead-lag timing all work together. Watch the logic cycle like a real controllerâ€”no cabinet required.
