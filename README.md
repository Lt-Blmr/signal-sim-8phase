# Signal-Sim: 8-Phase NEMA Intersection Simulator

Signal-Sim is a fully-actuated, dual-ring NEMA traffic signal simulator. Designed for traffic engineers, hobbyists, and transportation tech nerds, it models real-world intersections with protected/permissive lefts, LPIs, flashing yellows, and pedestrian phase logic.

## Features
- 8-phase dual-ring controller logic
- Fully-actuated vehicle and pedestrian inputs
- Protected lefts, flashing yellow arrows, pedestrian timers
- GUI-ready layout for simulation or physical model
- Designed with WSDOT/NEMA guidance

## Coming Soon
- Raspberry Pi hardware implementation
- LED display integration
- Controller debug outputs and pedestrian push logic

Made for engineers. Inspired by intersections. Runs on logic (and caffeine).
